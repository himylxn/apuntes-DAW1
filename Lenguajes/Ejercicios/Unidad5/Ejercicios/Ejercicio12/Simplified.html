   and ball to a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of this town on board l'Illustre,
   of seventy-four guns. The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge, received
   the company at Foster's wharf, before 12 o'clock–and on the appearance of the first
   boat having ladies on board, a signal gun was fired from l'Illustre, and in an instant
   the squadron was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations. On arriving at
   the ship, the company were very politely received by the Viscount, and conducted to
   the state room–the marines saluting as the company passed them. At one o'clock the
   whole sat down to a table liberally spread with a profusion of luxuries and delicacies,
   in a hall erected for the occasion, which was very fancifully decorated. At the head
   of the table was a castle of pastry, having thirteen metal guns, by which from tubes
   that communicated through the table, and the company were saluted with a f–deral discharge.
   On the top of the castle waved a small white ensign–the device, two hearts –the motto,
   " The United hearts of America and France." The head of the hall was ornamented with
   a heart pieced with arrows–and in the motton, " Homage to the fair daughters of America,"
   a fine compliment made by the noble Viscount to his female guests. After dinner, the
   ball began, and closed before nine o'clock, and on departure, his Excellency was saluted
   with thirteen rockets let off from a boat moored at some distance from the ship.</p><hr><p style="color:red;">[64]</p><p>Glasgow</p><p>No fewer than nine  young ladies are going to the Market  of Love  in India, on board

   that there has been a very fine harvest in the Southern States, and that the wheat
   has been wonderfully productive. A very large quantity had been bought up for the
   Spanish markets. The quality of European goods, imported the last season was immense,
   goods selling for considerable loss ; and such will always be the case when the Merchants
   in England anticipate a ray of fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The appearance of
   a Spanish war had given them great prospects of commercial advantages, and a seven

   amazed at the offer of the magnificent present, said, through his interpreter, " that
   even in his won country he should be unable to repay it ; however, at present he would
   do the utmost in his power ;" on this he ordered the actor to approach him, and then
   lighting his Cherokee pipe stuffed with a variety of nauseous combustibles, he too
   three whiffs himself, and presenting the tube, desired the actor to take three whiffs
   also–the greatest favour a Cherokee could confer ; the actor, aastonished at the singularity
   of this unexpected honour, reluctantly complied with the request,to the great entertainment

   are all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty - five or twenty-six. These six
   Chiefs have 20,000 warriors ready to take the field, and have the strongest wish to
   act in conjunction with the English. They travelled 3000 miles before the reached
   Halifax, and were near 12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went
   in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, by whom they were sent over to
   England to concert their plans in person with the Ministry.</p><hr><p style="color:red;">[322]</p><p>Glasgow</p><p> When hostilities are once commenced, a forfidable armament will unquestionable be

   near two hundred miles around the river. That M'Gilvray, and his army of savages,
   after an unsuccessful and bloody engagement, had fled to the woods, where the General
   left them, and returned to Savannah.– This expedition was undertaken about the beginning
   of March, winch has been crowned with the expected catastrophe, and though the Cherokee,
   Miami, and Chiquesaw tribes, may mediate revenge at some future period; it is not
   likely they will be in a condition to disturb the settlers for some years to come.</p><hr><p style="color:red;">[341]</p><p>Glasgow</p><p>From the Jamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston, Nov. 28.</p><hr><p style="color:red;">[342]</p><p>Glasgow</p><p>Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated the 9th May last, mention, that General
   Wayne had been dispatched, in the beginning of March, on an expedition against the
   Cherokee Miamis and Chickesau Indians, who have, for some time past, had as their
   chief warrior, one Macgillivray, a Scotchman, who has long resided among these Indians.
   General Wayne, at the head of two thousand Provincials, had completely routed them
   after a great slaughter. After the battle, Macgillivray and his savages took refuge
   in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most part of the habitation of these
   Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river, which is the boundary
   of Georgia, after which he returned to Savannah. This defeat is so total, that it
   will put it out of the power of these Indians to be again troublesome to the State
   of Virginia.</p><hr><p style="color:red;">[343]</p><p>Glasgow</p><p>The American States having now gained their independence, have no cause of quarrel

   well known, that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied
   with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, to enable
   them to distress the Americans, and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The
   free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards, now in
   possession of the Floridas, have been continually quarrelling with them about their

   and crew of the brig Exuma, which arrived there some days before from Newfoundland,
   having in the course of their passage fallen in with a French schooner, Captain Alward
   asked the Captain of the schooner to accommodate him with some nails, which he politely
   did; at the same time begging his acceptance of some barracoutes caught that morning.
   Captain Aylward and his crew having dined off them the same day, they were immediately
   seized with violent sickness convulsive fits, and other dangerous symptoms. The Captain,
   judging that the fish they had eaten were of a poisonous nature, conceived that salt
   water might be of service, he instantly made the expedient on himself, which relieved
   him greatly ; he applied the same remedy to his crew and it was attended with good
   effects. When this unfortunate accident happened, it was luckily a dead calm ; had
   the weather been tempestous, it is more than probable the ship and crew would have
   been lost, as during their sickness, there was not a man able to stand by the helm.</p><hr><p style="color:red;">[398]</p><p>Glasgow</p><p>By letters received from Norfolk in Virginia, dated the 23rd of July, we learn that
   on the 10th of that month the ship Betsey of Greenock, Capt. James Young, had arrived
   there in 19 days from Jamaica, and brought the following melancholy relation which
   he received from the crew of the Prudence, whom she picked up on the 1st of Juin lat.
   22. 40. long. 85. 32. That from the 7th to the 10th of June the weather had been very
   hazy, with little wind, so that Capt Addies could not get an observation, and a strong
   current setting to the Southward and Westward, drove them farther leeward than they
   imagined. On the 12th, about 3 o'clock in the morning, the watch discovered Cape Catuloh,
   but before intelligence could be given to the Captain, she struck.  For some time
   she made no water but about seven the water came in so fast, that by eleven o'clock,
   A. M. the water was six feet in the hold (the depth of the water in which she lay,)
   the people being sixteen in number, took to their long boat, and endeavoured to make
   Cape Antonie; but after four days fruitless labour they were obliged to return to
   the wreck, where they found two Spaniards plundering, who informed them that there
   were only four inhabitants on the island, and therefore they could receive no assistance
   from them; upon which, having taken a quantity of beef and biscuits aboard, they left
   the wreck a second time, and after having been absent fourteen days, were providentially
   picked up by the ship Betsey, and carried to Norfolk in Virginia.</p><hr><p style="color:red;">[400]</p><p>Glasgow</p><p>The Cherokee Chiefs are not to be presented at Court. After seeing every thing of

   5 to 6 guineas.</p><hr>
